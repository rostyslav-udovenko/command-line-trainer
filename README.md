# Сommand Line Trainer

An easy-to-use terminal simulator that operates within your web browser, designed to assist you in mastering fundamental UNIX-like commands through a virtual file system.

This initiative aims to guide newcomers in learning terminal commands progressively, all within a welcoming and interactive online setting.

## 🧠 Features

- Command-line interactions that allow for inputs such as `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `pwd`, `help`, and `man`
- Immediate task validation accompanied by feedback and hints for each task
- An integrated virtual file system that refreshes with each task, utilizing JSON
- A modular architecture based on ES modules
- A user experience designed entirely for keyboard navigation, eliminating the need for a mouse

## 🔡 Example Commands

```bash
$ cd projects
$ mkdir images
$ touch index.html
$ pwd
$ help
$ man cd
```

## 🆘 Help System

You can type `help` at any time to get a list of available commands:

```
$ help
Available commands: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, help, man
Use man <command> for more information.
```

Each command also has its own manual page via `man`:

```
$ man touch
touch — create a new file
```

## 🧪 Tasks

Each task is described as a JSON file and includes:

- `description` – what you need to do
- `fs` – starting virtual file system structure
- `check` – validation rule (e.g. directory exists, file created, current path)
- `hint` – helpful tip if your command is incorrect

## 📦 Modular JavaScript Structure

The application code is organized into well-structured ES module files to enhance both scalability and clarity:
```
js/ 
 ├── main.js                # Entry point, initializes everything 
 ├── terminal-ui.js         # Handles UI: output, input, scrolling
 ├── file-system.js         # Virtual file system operations
 ├── command-executor.js    # Command definitions and execution logic 
 └── task-manager.js        # Task loading, validation and flow control
 ```

 ## 🗂 File Structure

```
project-root/
├── index.html               # UI shell and entry point
├── css/
